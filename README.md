## Custom loadbalancing for SO_REUSEPORT with eBPF

SO_REUSEPORT is a powerful feature of the Linux kernel that allows users to have more than one process listen on a given port and allow for load balancing between them. The default load-balancing strategy is round-robin, but with the help of eBPF, we can take this feature one step further and implement other load-balancing strategies. In this lightning talk, youâ€™ll learn to implement weighted and hot standby load balancing with nothing but eBPF and SO_REUSEPORT.
